## Welcome

Hello, I'm currently a seventh grader living in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This website will mainly function as an area for code I write, as well as bit of a blog in [writing](/writing/) as of when I'm writing this, I'm trying to publish every week in [writing](/writing/), so you can check that out.
