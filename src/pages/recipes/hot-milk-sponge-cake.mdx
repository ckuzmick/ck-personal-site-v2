# Hot Milk Sponge Cake
`by Marilyn M. Moore`

## Ingredients
¾ cup `all purpose flour`
¾ tsp `baking powder`
¼ tsp `salt`
⅓ cup `milk`
1 tbsp `sweet butter`
2 `large eggs`
¾ cup `granulated sugar`
½ tsp `vanilla extract`

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350. Grease a 9-inch round layer cake pan. Line bottom with wax paper. Grease paper and then lightly flour the lined pan.
2. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together and set aside. Sifting is important here!
3. In a small saucepan heat the milk and butter until the milk is hot and the butter is melted. Remove from heat.
4. In large bowl of mixer, beat eggs until thick. Gradually add sugar, beating all the while. At low speed, blend in the vanilla, then the dry ingredients, then the hot milk mixture. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until cake springs back when lightly touched in the center. Cool in the pan on a rack for 5 minutes. Turn out on the rack and peel off paper. Invert onto another rack and cool completely.
